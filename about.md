# About Me

I am a Goldstine Fellow at IBM Research in New York. In 2020, I completed my PhD at Princeton University under the supervision of Amir Ali Ahmadi. Before joining Princeton, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique.

I am broadly interested in Polynomial Optimization, Dynamical Systems & Control, and Machine Learning. You can learn more about my work by having a look at my papers.
