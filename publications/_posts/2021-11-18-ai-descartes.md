Scientists have long aimed to discover meaningful formulae which accurately describe experimental data. One
common approach is to manually create mathematical models of natural phenomena using domain knowledge,
then fit these models to data. In contrast, machine-learning algorithms automate the construction of accurate
data-driven models while consuming large amounts of data. Ensuring that such models are consistent with existing
knowledge is an open problem. We develop a method for combining logical reasoning with symbolic regression,
enabling principled derivations of models of natural phenomena. We demonstrate these concepts for Kepler’s third
law of planetary motion, Einstein’s relativistic time-dilation law, and Langmuir’s theory of adsorption, automatically
connecting experimental data with background theory in each case. We show that laws can be discovered from few
data points when using formal logical reasoning to distinguish the correct formula from a set of plausible formulas
that have similar error on the data. The combination of reasoning with machine learning provides generalizable
insights into key aspects of natural phenomena. We envision that this combination will enable derivable discovery
of fundamental laws of science. We believe that this is a crucial first step for connecting the missing links in
automating the scientific method.
